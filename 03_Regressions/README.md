## 03_Regressions content

This folder contains the regressions performed on the microbial data in FGFP

* 03.1 Is the first set of regressions performed on the covariate PRS -> covariate. This is a sanity check to ensure our PRSs are working as intended

* 03.2 Takes the output from 03.1 to find consistent associations between the observational and PRS estimate for the same bug. This is done through filtering down to observational estimates with pval of beta coefficient less than 0.05 and a directionaly consistent beta coef for the PRS analysis
